The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive time series analysis of historical executed trades on the exchange. The primary hypothesis is that discernible patterns exist within the trade execution data, indicating potential opportunities for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making. Leveraging statistical techniques including Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests, visual analysis of trends and seasonality, and the examination of rolling statistics, this study aims to ascertain the stationarity of the trade data and identify any underlying patterns or dependencies. Additionally, the research will explore the potential impact of outliers, perform residual diagnostics on models, and consider transformation techniques to enhance the stationarity of the time series data. The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights that could facilitate more informed trade execution strategies and risk management in the exchange market
