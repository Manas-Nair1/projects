# Assumptions and general method
We are trying to model V(t,s) - which is the value of a contingent claim as a funciton of time(deterministic Process) and a underlying stock price(stochastic process). We will use no-arbitrage pricing, which states that if two "strategies" have the same payout, they must have the same price/risk associated as otherwise arbitrage opportunities would exist in the market. 
# Construction of the portfolio
We first construct a portfolio which buys some contingent claim worth V(t,s) and sells some shares against it. The amount of shares is the value denoted by delta and S represents the stock price.
