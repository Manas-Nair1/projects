# Cointegration
As it is accepted that any single tradable asset follows GBM and is not mean-reverting, we will build a portfolio of 2 separate assets in a manner commonly refered to as a 'pairs trade.' The general idea is that the 2 assets should be chosen such that they are susceptible to similar market factors. Occasionally, their relative stock prices diverge due to certain events, but will revert to the long-term mean.
